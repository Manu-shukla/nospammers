# No Spammers
• NO spammers is a Deep Learning based model where we can detect whether the mail received by any user is a spam or not. 

• We are also categorically dividing the type of spam mails you are receiving. 

• We are using robust regression approaches for data refining and predective algorithms to train the model.
